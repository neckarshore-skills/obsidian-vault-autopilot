# YAML Sanity — Pre-Write Defense-in-Depth

## Purpose

Every property-writing skill calls this sanity-check BEFORE attempting any
YAML edit (recipes b/c/d/e per `references/yaml-edits.md`). The check returns
a verdict the skill uses to decide: proceed, repair, or skip-with-finding.

## When to call

Step zero of any property-write workflow:

- `property-enrich` Step 2a (before Compute / Source Hierarchy walk) AND pre-Write (Step 5)
- `property-describe` Step 2a (before Filter — eligibility check) AND pre-Write (Step 5)
- `note-rename` Step 4a (before Classify cooldown logic)
- `inbox-sort` Step 5a (before Cooldown evaluation)
- `property-classify` (v0.2.0+) Step 2 (before Type/Status detection)

## Procedure

1. Read frontmatter lines per `references/yaml-edits.md` recipe (a). Strip a UTF-8 BOM (U+FEFF, bytes `EF BB BF`) from line 0 before the `---` comparison — a BOM is invisible in most editors and must not make real frontmatter look absent (see recipe (a) BOM note).
2. Structural checks (Pattern 3) run before the no-frontmatter early-return: if line 0 (after BOM-strip) is `---` but no closing `---` exists, return `UNCLOSED_FRONTMATTER` immediately. Recipe (a) reports such a file as "no frontmatter" — that is a read-result, not a verdict. An unclosed block is Class-A, not absent: early-returning `OK_NO_FRONTMATTER` here would let recipe (c) prepend a second block and corrupt the file further.
3. If no frontmatter exists (line 0 after BOM-strip is not `---`): return verdict `OK_NO_FRONTMATTER`.
4. Walk frontmatter lines. Match each line against detection patterns (§ "Detection patterns" below). Collect findings.
5. Walk the entire file (not just frontmatter) for multi-block detection.
6. Return verdict + finding list.

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning | Action by skill |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `OK` | Frontmatter is well-formed, only plain-identifier keys | Proceed normally |
| `OK_QUOTED` | Frontmatter has standard quoted-keys (shape α — `"key":`, valid YAML) but no inside-colon shape and no other issues | Proceed normally; skill regexes must accept both plain and standard-quoted forms |
| `OK_NO_FRONTMATTER` | File has no frontmatter to inspect | Proceed normally — recipe (c) creates one if needed |
| `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON` | One or more shape β inside-colon patterns detected (`"<key>:":`) — F26 | Repair via recipe (f) (if skill is repair-capable) OR skip + Class-C finding (additive-only skills) |
| `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` | Two or more frontmatter lines define the same key with divergent non-empty values (after shape β normalize, if any). F7 family. | Skip + Class-A finding "duplicate-key-divergent-values". Route to user / `note-rename` for manual resolution. Recipe (f) does NOT auto-resolve — file is left unchanged to preserve user intent. |
| `DUPLICATE_KEYS_IDENTICAL_VALUES` | Two or more frontmatter lines define the same key with identical values (no inside-colon shape required). | Repair via recipe (f) silent dedup (keep first, remove rest, Class-D finding per removed line). Same operational path as `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON` for repair-capable skills. |
| `MULTIPLE_FRONTMATTER_BLOCKS` | Two or more `---/---` pairs at frontmatter-boundary positions | Skip + Class-A finding. Route to `note-rename` corrupted-file-detection if not already there. |
| `UNCLOSED_FRONTMATTER` | First line `---` but no matching closing `---` | Skip + Class-A finding. User-investigation required. |
| `INVALID_YAML` | Detection patterns OK but YAML still unparseable (rare) | Skip + Class-A finding. Manual review. |

**Verdict-priority:** A file may match multiple patterns. Verdict order: `MULTIPLE_FRONTMATTER_BLOCKS` > `UNCLOSED_FRONTMATTER` > `INVALID_YAML` > `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` > `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON` > `DUPLICATE_KEYS_IDENTICAL_VALUES` > `OK_QUOTED` > `OK_NO_FRONTMATTER` > `OK`. Highest matching verdict wins. Cosmetic findings logged regardless of verdict.

**Why divergent > inside-colon > identical:** A file with shape β AND divergent-value duplicates is BOTH broken-keyed AND ambiguous. The divergent ambiguity dominates because it requires user-action regardless of repair-capability — the skill must NOT silently pick a winner. Inside-colon-only (no divergent dup) is repairable and dominates over identical-only-duplicates because shape β makes the YAML unparseable, while identical plain duplicates parse (most YAML parsers tolerate identical-value duplicates with a warning) but should still be dedupped for cleanliness.

## Detection patterns

### Pattern 1 — Inside-colon quoted-key (shape β — F26)

**Per-line regex (single-line input — safe per yaml-edits.md):**

```python
F26_INSIDE_COLON_PATTERN = re.compile(r'^(\s*)"([^"]+):"\s*:(.*)$')
```

The crucial structure: `:"` BEFORE the closing quote AND `\s*:` AFTER the closing quote. Both colons are required to match.

**Match groups:**
1. Leading whitespace (preserve indentation)
2. Key name (without surrounding quotes, without trailing-colon-inside-quotes)
3. Everything after the value-colon (the value, possibly with trailing comment)

**Example:**

```
"created:": 2024-03-14
```

Match groups: `("", "created", " 2024-03-14")`.

**Verdict contribution:** if any line matches → `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON`.

### Pattern 1b — Standard quoted-key (shape α — F25)

**Per-line regex (single-line input):**

```python
F25_STANDARD_QUOTED_PATTERN = re.compile(r'^(\s*)"([^":]+)"\s*:(.*)$')
```

The crucial part: `[^":]+` inside the brackets — NO `"` and NO `:` allowed inside the key name. This is what distinguishes shape α from shape β.

**Match groups:**
1. Leading whitespace
2. Key name (without surrounding quotes)
3. Everything after the value-colon

**Example:**

```
"description": A standard quoted-key value
```

Match groups: `("", "description", " A standard quoted-key value")`.

**Verdict contribution:** if any line matches AND no shape-β line matches → `OK_QUOTED`. If both shapes coexist on different lines → `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON` wins (the broken shape signals to the skill to repair, then re-scan).

**No repair needed.** Standard quoted-keys are valid YAML. Skill regexes must simply accept this shape (see per-skill policy table below).

### Detection-precedence rule (critical)

Walk inside-colon pattern FIRST, standard quoted-key SECOND. The inside-colon pattern is a strict subset (must contain inside-colon); standard pattern matches any quoted-key WITHOUT inside-colon.

A line like `"description:":` matches inside-colon (verdict β), NOT standard (because the `:` inside `[^":]+` is forbidden). A line like `"description":` matches standard (verdict α), NOT inside-colon.

### Pattern 2 — Multiple frontmatter blocks

Walk the entire file (not just frontmatter). Count occurrences of lines where `.rstrip() == '---'`. Treat first occurrence at line 0 as frontmatter open. Treat next occurrence as frontmatter close.

After the close, if a subsequent line is also `.rstrip() == '---'` AND is NOT inside a code-fence (no triple-backtick opening before it), AND a subsequent matching `---` exists, AND at least one line between the two `---` markers matches a YAML-key-like pattern (`^\s*[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_-]*\s*:` OR `^\s*"[^"]+"\s*:`): this is a SECOND frontmatter block.

Otherwise (no YAML-key-like lines between the pair): body-level horizontal-rule separator — not a frontmatter block, no verdict contribution.

> **Why this matters:** Body-level `---` horizontal-rule pairs are common in longer notes. Without the YAML-content check, any note with two `---` separators in the body produces a false-positive `MULTIPLE_FRONTMATTER_BLOCKS` verdict. Empirically confirmed: 72 false positives in GR-2 Cell 4 re-run (2026-04-30) on nexus-clone-powershell (1016 files); all were body horizontal-rule pairs, zero genuine second frontmatter blocks.

**Verdict contribution:** if two or more genuine frontmatter blocks → `MULTIPLE_FRONTMATTER_BLOCKS`.

This pattern is canonically defined in `note-rename`'s Corrupted File Detection (SKILL.md § "Corrupted File Detection"). The sanity-check uses the same detection logic, exposed as a callable.

### Pattern 3 — Unclosed frontmatter

If line 0 is `---` but no subsequent line equals `---`: frontmatter never closes. **Verdict:** `UNCLOSED_FRONTMATTER`.

### Pattern 4 — Cosmetic-only (Class-D)

Whitespace-only lines between final field and closing `---`. Or trailing whitespace on a frontmatter field line. These are non-blocking.

**Verdict contribution:** logged in finding list, but verdict stays at the worst non-cosmetic verdict found.

### Pattern 5 — Duplicate-key detection (universal, post-Pattern-1-normalize)

Walk a *post-shape-β-normalize* view of the frontmatter (in-memory; this view is what recipe-f would produce in its Step 2 if invoked). Index lines by key-name. For each key-name appearing on ≥ 2 lines, collect the per-line value strings.

**Per-line value extraction:** strip leading whitespace, strip the `<key>:` prefix, strip leading/trailing whitespace from the remainder, strip a trailing comment (`# ...`). The resulting normalized value string is what gets compared.

**Sub-case branching:**
- All collected value strings are byte-identical → `DUPLICATE_KEYS_IDENTICAL_VALUES` finding (per-key-name).
- Any pair of value strings differs → `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` finding (per-key-name). Empty-string values are treated as identical to each other but divergent vs any non-empty (defensive default — empty values almost certainly indicate a stub the user did not finish; keep the non-empty value's question alive).

**Verdict contribution:**
- If any divergent finding → `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` (Class-A territory).
- Else if any identical finding → `DUPLICATE_KEYS_IDENTICAL_VALUES` (Class-D-aggregate verdict, repairable).
- Else → no contribution from Pattern 5.

**Detection-precedence interaction:** Pattern 5 walks the *post-normalize* view, so a file with shape β AND a divergent duplicate against the normalized form (cell A) yields `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` (verdict-priority puts divergent above shape β). A file with shape β AND identical duplicate against the normalized form (cell B) yields `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON` (the broken shape signals repair-needed; recipe-f's silent dedup handles the identical collision as Class-D side effect). A file with no shape β but plain divergent duplicates (cell C) yields `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` directly. A file with no shape β but plain identical duplicates (cell D) yields `DUPLICATE_KEYS_IDENTICAL_VALUES`.

**Worked example (cell A — F7 empirical case):**

Input:

```yaml
---
"status:": draft
status: ready-for-designer
title: F7 case
---
```

1. Walk lines.
2. Line 1: matches Pattern 1 (shape β, key `status`).
3. Line 2: plain key `status`.
4. Compute post-normalize view: `[status: draft, status: ready-for-designer, title: F7 case]`.
5. Pattern 5 walk: key `status` appears twice. Values: `draft`, `ready-for-designer`. Byte-different → divergent.
6. Verdict: `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` (priority dominates `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON`).
7. Findings: 1× duplicate-key-divergent-values for key `status` (Class A), 1× shape-β cosmetic for `"status:"` line (informational).

## Per-skill policy

| Skill | On Class-A (multi-block / unclosed) | On `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` | On `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON` (shape β) | On `DUPLICATE_KEYS_IDENTICAL_VALUES` | On `OK_QUOTED` (shape α) | On Class-D cosmetic |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| `property-enrich` | skip + Class-A finding (route to user / note-rename) | skip + Class-A finding "duplicate-key-divergent-values" (route to user / note-rename) — recipe (f) does NOT auto-resolve | repair via Step 2a recipe (f), then re-run sanity-check (idempotent fixpoint) | repair via Step 2a recipe (f) silent dedup, then re-run sanity-check | proceed; skill regex matches both shapes | proceed |
| `note-rename` | use existing Corrupted File Detection (rename file with corruption-label) | skip + Class-A finding "duplicate-key-divergent-values" (route to user; do NOT rename — file may legitimately need user merge first) | repair via Step 4a recipe (f) (broadened from existing hardcoded-list) | repair via Step 4a recipe (f) silent dedup | proceed; skill regex matches both shapes | proceed |
| `inbox-sort` | skip + Class-A finding (route to note-rename) | skip + Class-A finding "duplicate-key-divergent-values" (route to user / note-rename) | repair via Step 5a recipe (f) (broadened from existing hardcoded-list) | repair via Step 5a recipe (f) silent dedup | proceed; skill regex matches both shapes | proceed |
| `property-describe` | skip + Class-A finding | skip + Class-A finding "duplicate-key-divergent-values" (route to user / property-enrich for resolution) | SKIP + Class-C finding "broken-yaml: inside-colon shape detected — run property-enrich first" (NOT repair — boundaries: describe is additive-only) | SKIP + Class-C finding "duplicate-keys-identical: run property-enrich first to dedup" (additive-only — defer to repair-capable skill) | proceed; broadened filter regex catches both plain and standard-quoted forms | proceed |
| `property-classify` (v0.2.0) | skip + finding | skip + finding | skip + finding | skip + finding | proceed; broadened regex | proceed |

Defense-in-depth lives in the **sanity-check call itself**: skills that already have repair logic in their workflow (enrich, rename, sort) are calling sanity-check as a Step-zero pre-flight. If sanity-check returns Class-A, skill skips. If Class-C (`BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON`), skill calls its own repair step. If both succeed, skill proceeds normally.

## Idempotency

After a repair-skill runs the inside-colon-quoted-key normalization (recipe f) AND no `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES` was present pre-repair, calling the sanity-check again on the same file MUST return `OK`, `OK_QUOTED`, or `OK_NO_FRONTMATTER` (any non-`BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON` non-Class-A verdict). This is the contract: repair is permanent within the run, normalize + identical-dedup are idempotent.

**Exception — divergent-value abort path:** if pre-repair sanity-check returned `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES`, recipe (f) does NOT modify the file (per recipe (f) Step 3 branching — see `references/yaml-edits.md`). Post-recipe sanity-check therefore still returns `DUPLICATE_KEYS_DIVERGENT_VALUES`. This is intentional: the file is in an ambiguous state that requires user-action; recipe (f) prevents silent value-loss by refusing to pick a winner. Caller must skip the file and route to user / note-rename per the per-skill policy table.

**Why this is still correct as a contract:** Idempotency means "running twice is equivalent to running once." Both runs of recipe (f) on a divergent-duplicate file produce the same result (no change, same verdict). The contract holds; it just terminates in a non-OK state when the file is genuinely ambiguous.

## Worked example

Input file (broken — shape β):

```yaml
---
"created:": 2024-03-14
"description:": Apple Notes export
tags: [AppleNoteImport]
---
```

`property-enrich` calls sanity-check:

1. Walk frontmatter lines.
2. Line 1: matches `F26_INSIDE_COLON_PATTERN` → finding ("created").
3. Line 2: matches `F26_INSIDE_COLON_PATTERN` → finding ("description").
4. Line 3: no match.
5. Return `BROKEN_KEYS_INSIDE_COLON` with two findings.

Skill calls Step 2a normalize (recipe f):

1. Replace line 1: `created: 2024-03-14`
2. Replace line 2: `description: Apple Notes export`

Re-call sanity-check: returns `OK`. Skill proceeds.

`property-describe` later runs on same file (now repaired): sanity-check returns `OK`. Filter detects `description: Apple Notes export` (length 20 ≥ 10) → file already has description → skip (eligible-skip, not error-skip).

## Why a separate file

`yaml-edits.md` defines the WRITE recipes (b, c, d, e) and the prerequisite read recipe (a). Recipe (f) (normalize) lives in `yaml-edits.md` too, as the canonical write-side procedure.

`yaml-sanity.md` defines the PRE-WRITE check that runs before any of those recipes. They are complementary: yaml-edits.md is "how to safely edit"; yaml-sanity.md is "should we attempt to edit at all".
